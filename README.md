# rosalind_transitions-transversions
Calculates the ratio of transitions to transversions between two DNA sequences.

This code is a solution to the problem Transitions and Transversions found on the Rosalind website.

DNA bases A and G have a nitrogenous base with a double ring structure and are termed purines.
Bases T and C have a nitrogenous base with a single ring structure and are termed pyrimidines.

When comparing two DNA sequences, if a different base is found at the same position of the sequences we can call this a point mutation.
If a point mutation is the result of a purine substituting for a pyrimidine or vice versa, this is termed a transition.
If the substitution is for purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine this is termed a transition.
